<p align="center">  
 This app uses [Face detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection) to get the of the face landmarks coordinates.
 Then it sends them to the [Processing Canvis](https://android.processing.org/) to draw a polygons mask that updates in real time from the [CameraX live feed](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax)
